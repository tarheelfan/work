# DungeonGame
Dungeon game written in C for COMS 327 at ISU

This program for this HW has the game functionality commented out. All that remains functional is the parsing of the file. After parsing it creates
a npcInfo object and uses a built in fuction to print the data from inside the object to prove that the correct data is being parsed and processed. Currently these objects are not doing anything and not stored yet but will be stored for when I need to use them in the next HW.
